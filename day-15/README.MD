### Arrays

* To work with a chunk of data, we need to represent it in computer memory. Let's say we want to store a list of numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.
* We could use separate variables (not efficient) for each one or we can represent it in a string "2 3 5 7 11" (need a way to extract and convert back to Number) 
* Fortunately: javascript provides data type specifically for storing sequence of values. It is called an **array** and is represented by `[]` separated by `,`

```javascript
let listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];
console.log(listOfNumbers[2]);
// → 5
console.log(listOfNumbers[0]);
// → 2
console.log(listOfNumbers[2 - 1]);
// → 3

```
* Array elements are accessed with `[]` also by providing and `index` - location of the that value in the array.
:warning: Zero-based counting has a long tradition in technology and in certain ways makes a lot of sense, but it takes some getting used to.
