# Functions

Functions are the most important part of JavaScript Language. It gives us the ability to wrap a program in a value, which reduces repeating ourselves and modularity.
Like we humans have a vocabulary to use in our speech, JavaScript has also a vocabulary that has about 20,000 words in it. With the help of fuctions we can expand on this vocabulary to create our own.
