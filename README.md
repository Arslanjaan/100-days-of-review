# 100-days-of-code
 Repository contains work done from August 1, 2020 until November 9, 2020

## Day 1 - README.MD basics

Great documentation of formatting syntax at [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) 

### Headings

Headings are just like `h1`, `h2` .. `h6` in `html`. # means `h1` ###### means `h6`.

```
# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
###### The smallest heading
```

### Styling 

There are 3 styling I usually use: **Bold**, *Italic* and ~~Strikethrough~~

```
**Bold**
*Italic* 
~~ Strikethrough ~~
```

Also these 3 can be combined. For example:  
**Bold _and nested_ Italic**  
***Bold and Italic***
```
**Bold _and nested_ Italic**
***Bold and Italic***
```
