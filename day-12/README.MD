### Course Intro

  JavaScript is the programming language of the web. It started out as a way to add small bits of functionality to a website, but now JavaScript has evolved into much more. JavaScript is used on the vast majority of websites and is supported by every major browser. The language has evolved to support the creation of business applications on the web. And with web connectivity built in, almost any kind of utility, security, or data application can be created using JavaScript. Games can be created with JavaScript as well. You may have heard of Unity, a popular game engine for 3D and 2D games. JavaScript is supported as a programming language for this engine. For large business applications, JavaScript is popular and has been embraced by a scalable language called TypeScript. This language is a superset of JavaScript, so you'll need to understand JavaScript well in order to write large‑scale business applications and other software using TypeScript. JavaScript is not just for applications which run in browsers on the web. You can also create native applications for smartphones and tablets using JavaScript. A popular technology for this is Apache Cordova. JavaScript can also be used to create full‑fledged applications for the Mac and Windows desktops. There's no need for a browser at all. A popular technology to accomplish this is Electron. Writing server‑side code can also be accomplished in JavaScript. You can create web servers, web APIs, and other services using a technology called Node.js. So JavaScript is a multi‑platform language. It will run in any modern web browser. It can be used to create native applications on smartphones and tablets, it can create desktop software for Mac and Windows computers, and it can be run on any back‑end server as well. No matter where you want your application to run, you can code it in JavaScript. In this course, I'll teach you the very basics of how to develop software using JavaScript. In the next clip, I'll show you how we can get up and running very quickly.
